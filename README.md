# W0D3 - "Hello World!" Exercise

Welcome to the "Hello World!" exercise! This assignment is designed to familiarize you with the process of completing and turning in coding challenges using GitHub repositories.

## Assignment Objective

By the end of this assignment, you should understand the steps involved in:
- Cloning a repository
- Navigating repository contents
- Reading instructions
- Writing code
- Running tests using pytest
- Pushing changes to GitHub

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will:
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local computer
2. Follow the instructions outlined in this `README.md` file
3. Write Python code in the `hello.py` file to print "Hello World!"
4. Run the provided tests using pytest to verify your code (screenshot the results)
5. Push your changes back to GitHub

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this assignment, you will:
1. Understand how to complete and turn in coding challenges using GitHub repositories
2. Learn to navigate repository contents and read instructions provided within files
3. Practice writing Python code to fulfill given requirements
4. Gain familiarity with running tests using pytest and interpreting their results

## Getting Started

To get started with the assignment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local computer using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory using your Command Line Interface (CLI):
   ```bash
   cd <folder name>
   ```

3. Open the `hello.py` file in your preferred code editor.

## Assignment Instructions

1. Locate the `hello_world()` function in the `hello.py` file.
2. Write Python code within the `hello_world()` function to print "Hello World!".
3. Save the `hello.py` file after writing your code.
4. Run the provided tests using pytest to verify your code:
   - Install pytest if not already installed:
     ```bash
     pip install pytest
     ```
   - Run the tests:
     ```bash
     pytest test_hello.py
     ```

5. If the tests pass, congratulations! You have completed the coding part of the assignment. If the tests fail, make necessary adjustments to your code and repeat step 4 until the tests pass. Take a screenshot and add it to Canvas.

6. Once your code passes the tests, it's time to push your changes to GitHub:
   - Stage your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Implement hello_world() function"
     ```
   - Push your changes to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

7. Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to the repository by checking the GitHub repository page.

8. Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.

## Estimated Completion Time

The estimated time to complete this assignment is approximately 20 minutes.

## Submission

Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas once you have completed the assignment.

Add your passing pytest screenshot.

```
